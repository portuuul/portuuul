- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @portuuul
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in IT and all the little intricacies that come along with it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to do some basic coding out of pure interest (and to be able to relate more to the software engineering peeps.)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Hotfixing is socially acceptable.
